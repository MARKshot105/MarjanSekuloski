	C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". 
	The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities 
	for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including 
	the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.
